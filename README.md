This project focuses on simulating chillers at the Moy Park food factory at two sites, Anwick and Dungannon, to compare and predict chiller consumption for optimization using a multi-agent system, aiming to reduce CO2 emissions.
The capacity of the chillers is up to 40000 chicken carcasses that we have simulated in
