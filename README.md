This project focuses on simulating chillers at the Moy Park food factory at two sites, Anwick and Dungannon, to compare and predict chiller consumption for optimization using a multi-agent system, aiming to reduce CO2 emissions. The capacity of the chillers is up to 40,000 chicken carcasses, and they spend two and a half hours in the chillers. We simulated this in Butterfly8.nlogo and applied the heat transfer equation to predict the temperature of each carcass.

Figure1. Simulation of chiller at the Moy Park

We plotted the data gathered from iButton sensors in MATLAB and then attempted to fit the figure obtained from the simulation in NetLogo.



We then calculated the time constant using the parameters obtained from the previous step to compare chiller consumption at different sites.
